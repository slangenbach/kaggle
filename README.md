# Kaggle
You may not find very many files in this repo since I try to use Kaggle kernels as much as possible when participating in competitions. Due to some limitations with these kernels, various jupyter notebooks and submission files for different competitions may pop in here.

List submissions/kernels:
* [Digit recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/submissions?sortBy=date&group=all&page=1)
* [Dog breed](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanbuenten/dog-breed-test-with-fastai/notebook)
* Planet: tbd
