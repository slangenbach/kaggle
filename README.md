# Kaggle
You may not find all files related to competitions in this repo since I try to use Kaggle kernels as much as possible when feasible. Due to some limitations with these kernels, various jupyter notebooks and submission files for different competitions may pop in here.

This is me on Kaggle, btw: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanbuenten
